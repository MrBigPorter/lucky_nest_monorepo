/**
 * Re-exports + local const arrays for @lucky/shared enums used in KYC DTOs.
 *
 * WHY this file exists:
 *   The @nestjs/swagger CLI plugin resolves TypeScript `enum` references with
 *   ts-morph, tracing through ALL re-exports back to the original declaration
 *   file. For cross-workspace packages (e.g. @lucky/shared → ../../packages/shared),
 *   it generates a relative path computed from the SOURCE file depth, then writes
 *   it into the COMPILED dist/ file — which is one directory deeper due to
 *   `outDir: "./dist"`. Result: the require() path is always one `../` short.
 *
 *   FIX: pass a plain `const string[]` to `@ApiProperty({ enum: ... })`.
 *   The plugin does NOT trace const arrays — it uses the value as-is.
 *   The TypeScript `enum` type is still used for type-checking via normal import.

 * instead of the enum class to avoid the plugin's broken cross-workspace require().
