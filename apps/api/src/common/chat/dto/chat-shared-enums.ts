/**
 * Re-exports + local const arrays for @lucky/shared enums used in Chat DTOs.
 *
 * WHY this file exists:
 *   The @nestjs/swagger CLI plugin resolves TypeScript `enum` identifiers via
 *   ts-morph, tracing through ALL re-exports to the original declaration.
 *   For workspace packages the generated require() path is computed from the
 *   SOURCE file depth but written into the COMPILED dist/ — which is one level
 *   deeper due to `outDir: "./dist"`. Result: always one `../` short.
 *
 *   FIX: pass a plain `const string[]` to @ApiProperty({ enum: ... }).
 *   The plugin does NOT trace const arrays — it uses the value as-is.
